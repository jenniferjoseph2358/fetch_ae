Hey team! After ingesting, investigating, transforming, and analyzing the new users, brands, and receipts datasets, I am happy to share the following update. 

What Has Been Built:
- We now have data on more than XX receipts and YYY receipt items, from AAA consumers. These datasets are packed with valuable datapoints such as 
  - For Users:
  - For Brands:
  - For Recipts:
Raw Data Concerns:
- (What questions do you have about the data?)
- (How did you discover the data quality issues?) 
- What do you need to know to resolve the data quality issues?


- 
Preliminary Business Questions:
- Without having the answers to the above, I have built the pipeline for answering a handful of questions I'd be happy to further discuss! 
- 
Next Steps: 
- With additional data collaboration, we will finalize the base models mentioned above and document how each dataset can be joined together for future analaytic insights. 
- 
Additional Notes: 
What other information would you need to help you optimize the data assets you're trying to create?
What performance and scaling concerns do you anticipate in production and how do you plan to address them?
